# equalize

Easily type LaTeX equations and drag or copy them anywhere as images.

Ever needed to send someone an equation they asked for? Want to add them to a note, but can't read your own handwriting?

Just jot down some LaTeX or TeX equations and drag them to where you want them or use the share sheet.
